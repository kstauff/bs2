<h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>
<hr/>


<p>The 2016 IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2016) provides a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to exchange their latest ideas and outcomes in research, technology and science. It is also the venue to exchange the latest advances in cyberspace studies with its broad scope of cyber-related sciences, technologies and applications topics. It will be held jointly with the 14th IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2016); the 14th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing (PICom 2016); and the Second IEEE International Conference on Big Data Intelligence and Computing (DataCom 2016). In addition to the technical program, the congres will also feature tutorials and panels.</p>
<p>CyberSciTech 2016 welcomes proposals for short and long tutorials from active researchers and experienced tutors. Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research, development and applications in new cyber-related sciences, technologies and applications. Examples include, but are not limited to (1) cyber science and fundamentals, (2) cyber physical computing and systems, (3) cyber social networks and computing, as well as (4) cyber mind and mental computing. High preference will be given towards tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, novel and emerging new cyber-enabled sciences, technologies and applications for the better society.</p>
<p>A proposal should cover the following items.</p>
<ol><li>Title</li>
<li>Abstract (up to 150 words)</li>
<li>Target audience and prerequisites (up to 100 words)</li>
<li>A list of forums with their time, locations and estimate of the number of attendees if the tutorial or a similar/highly related tutorial has been presented by the same authors before, and highlight the similarity/difference between those and the one proposed for CyberSciTech 2016 (up to 150 words for each entry)</li>
<li>A list of tutorials on the same/similar/highly related topics given by other people, and highlight the difference between yours and theirs (up to 150 words for each entry)</li>
<li>A list of other tutorials given by the authors, please list the titles, the presenters, the forums, locations and estimate of the number of attendees only</li>
<li>Authors’ short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to 150 words per tutor)</li>
<li>An outline of the tutorial in the form of a bullet list (up to one page)</li>
<li>Length of the tutorial: short (1.5-2 hours) or long (3-4 hours).</li>
<li>A list of up to 25 most important references that will be covered in the tutorial</li>
<li>Any specific audio/video/computer requirements for the tutorial</li>
<li>URLs of the slides/notes of the previous tutorials given by the authors</li>

<td valign="top" width="717">Advances in computers, information and networks, especially in the Internet and the Web, not only offer us novel services, but are also bringing about a digital cyberspace and a further digital cyber world. Numerous digital things or cyber entities will be generated and will reside in the cyber world, and countless real things in conventional physical, social and mental worlds will possess some cyber mappings or cyber components, so as to have a cyber existence. Cyberization is an emerging trend forming the new cyber world and reforming these conventional worlds towards cyber-enabled hyper worlds. It is absolutely necessary to establish a holistic and trans-disciplinary field, which we have called Cybermatics, to build systematic knowledge about new phenomena, behaviors, properties and practices in the cyberspace, cyberization and cyber-enabled hyper worlds. This tutorial is to first present the emerging trend of cyberization, then examine Cybermatics as a necessary field of study for cyberization, and finally explain what Cybermatics is and what it encompasses, and how it is related to other fields and areas. More about tutorial contents, please refer to “Cybermatics: A Holistic Field for Systematic Study of Cyber-enabled New Worlds,” in IEEE Access, vol. 3, pp. 2270-2280, 2015.<br>

<td valign="top" width="717">Patterns combine experience and good practices to develop models to build new systems and to evaluate existing systems. Security patterns encapsulate the extensive knowledge accumulated about security to provide guidelines for secure system design and evaluation. The speaker considers the structure and purpose of security patterns, and show a variety of security patterns including authentication, authorization, Web services security, and cloud security. He integrates patterns in the form of security reference architectures. This tutorial introduces patterns in a conceptual way, relating them to their purposes and to the functional parts of the architecture. The use of patterns can provide a holistic view of security, which is a fundamental principle to build secure systems. The speaker uses patterns and reference architectures to build cyber-physical systems and other cloud/IoT ecosystems. The patterns are shown using UML models and examples are taken from his two books on security patterns as well as from his recent publications.
