   	<p><strong>Theme: <em>Towards Cyber-Enabled New Sciences, Technologies and Applications for a Better Society</em></strong></p>
<p>We have been able to digitize almost everything. Besides, whatever we digitize, we can certainly integrate and analyze. That also enabled the emergence of a new paradigm on global information networks and infrastructures known as Cyberspace, which has emerged as the new frontier that seamlessly brings together physical, social and mental spaces. Cyberspace is evolving to become an integral component of our daily life bringing together work and private life; learning and entertainment, and business and cultural activities. As expected, this whole concept of cyberspace brings new challenges that need to be tackled.</p>
<p>To address these continuously emerging challenges, there is a need to establish new sciences and research portfolios that incorporates cyber-physical, cyber-social and cyber-mental together in a coherent manner to deliver the vision of Cyberspace. This is the aim of the 2016 IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2016) to offer a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to exchange their latest ideas and outcomes in research, technology and science. It is also a venue to exchange the latest advances in cyberspace studies with the broad scope of cyber-related sciences, technologies and applications topics.</p>
<p><strong>CyberSciTech 2016</strong> includes four main research tracks:</p>
<ul><li>Track 1: Cyber Science and Fundamentals</li>
<li>Track 2: Cyber-Physical Computing and Systems</li>
<li>Track 3: Cyber-Social Networks and Computing</li>
<li>Track 4: Cyber-Mind and Mental Computing</li>
</ul><p><strong>CyberSciTech 2016</strong> program also includes a series of events:</p>
<ul><li>Keynotes Speeches on Future CyberSciTech</li>
<li>Tutorials on Advanced CyberSciTech</li>
<li>Panels on CyberSciTech Challenges</li>
<li>Open Forum on Top Ten CyberSciTech Emerging Issues</li>
<li>Workshops related to CyberSciTech</li>
<li>Special Sessions related to CyberSciTech</li>
<li>Demo/Poster of CyberSciTech Researches & Applications</li>
</ul><p><strong>CyberSciTech 2016</strong> is co-located with the three conferences:</p>
<ul><li>The 14th IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2016)</li>
<li>The 14th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing (PICom 2016)</li>
<li>The 2nd IEEE International Conference on Big Data Intelligence and Computing (DataCom 2016)</li>
</ul>
